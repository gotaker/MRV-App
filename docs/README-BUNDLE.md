This archive includes everything you need to upgrade the MRV app to Angular 20 with Material 3.

## Contents

- `patch/mrv-angular20-patch.zip` — repo-agnostic patch pack: scripts to bump versions in your `package.json`/`angular.json`, plus add-on files (theme, Jest/Cypress, ESLint/Prettier, CI, Docker).

## Quick Start

### Option A — Upgrade existing repo
1. Unzip `patch/mrv-angular20-patch.zip` into your repo root.
2. Run the patch scripts:
   ```bash
   node scripts/patch-package-json.mjs
   node scripts/patch-angular-json.mjs
   ```
3. Install & verify:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run lint
   npm run test
   npm run build
   ```
4. (Optional) Wire up AWS deploy by adding repo secrets: `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`, `AWS_REGION`, `S3_BUCKET`, `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`.

### Option B — Start from scaffold
1. Unzip `scaffold/mrv-angular20-upgrade.zip`.
2. Copy your existing `/src` into the scaffold, reconcile routes/services, and run:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm start  # dev
   npm run build:prod
   ```

### Material 3 theme
- The theme is in `src/styles/theme.scss`.
- Light/dark mode toggled by adding `.dark-theme` on `<html>`.
