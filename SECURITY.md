# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We maintain the latest minor on the `main` branch (e.g., `0.1.x`). Older releases are not supported unless stated in the CHANGELOG.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please **do not** open public issues for security reports.
- Use GitHub **Security Advisories** (recommended) or email: **security@example.com**.
- Include reproduction steps, impact, and affected versions.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 2 business days and provide a fix or mitigation plan within 14 days.
